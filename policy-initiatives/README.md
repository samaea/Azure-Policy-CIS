## Quickstart
Push an policy initiative to Azure:

```powershell
az policy set-definition create --name {NAMEOFYOURINITIATIVE} --definitions '{PATHTOINITIATIVE}\policyset-definition.json' --management-group {MANAGEMENTGROUPNAME}
```

## Disclaimer
**This project is a work in progress, policies are to be taken on an 'as-is' basis. No garuntees are made, and it is understood that it is the users responsibilty to perform verification and testing.**
