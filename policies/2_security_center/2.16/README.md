### Description: 
Provide a security contact email address.

### Rationale: 
Microsoft reaches out to the designated security contact in case its security team finds that
the organization's resources are compromised. This ensures that the proper people are
aware of any potential compromise in order to mitigate the risk in a timely fashion.
